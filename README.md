# ROS2-Humble-Turtlesim-Installation-via-VM-
ROS2 Humble – Turtlesim Installation through linux VM
This  assignment explain how to set up ROS2 Humble on Ubuntu and use the Turtlesim package to perform basic tasks. The goal is to understand ROS2 basics, work with nodes, topics, services, and parameters using a simple turtle simulation.

Also,through these tasks, we learned:
•	How to run and manage ROS2 nodes.
•	Using topics for communication (keyboard → turtle).
•	Using services to spawn new turtles.
•	Using parameters to change the environment.
•	Controlling multiple robots in the same simulation.
Turtlesim provides a simple but powerful way to understand the core concepts of ROS2.

Please refer to uploaded docuemnts for more inforamtion.
